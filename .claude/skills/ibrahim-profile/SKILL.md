# Ibrahim Profile Reference

## Purpose

Load Ibrahim's personal profile so you can accurately answer motivation-based, behavioral, and culture-fit job application questions. This covers the "why" behind his career -- his motivations, key stories, communication preferences, values, and personal details that the resume alone doesn't capture.

## Workflow

1. Read the profile file at the project root:

```
ibrahim.md
```

2. Use the profile content to craft answers that are authentic to Ibrahim's voice and grounded in real experiences.

## Guidelines

- **Match his voice.** Ibrahim writes conversationally, not corporately. No buzzwords like "leverage," "synergy," or "unlock potential." Write like you're explaining something over coffee.
- **Use his real stories.** The profile contains ready-to-use stories mapped to common question types. Pull from those, don't invent new ones.
- **Paragraph format.** He prefers paragraph-style answers over bullet points for application responses.
- **No em dashes.** Stylistic preference he's consistent about.
- **Stay grounded.** If the profile doesn't cover something, say so. Don't infer or embellish.
- **Pair with /resume.** For questions that need both factual career details and personal motivation, load both this skill and the resume skill.
- **Respect sensitive details.** Follow the specific instructions in the profile (e.g., Palantir certification only, salary range only when asked).
