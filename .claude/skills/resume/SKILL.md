# Resume Reference

## Purpose

Load Ibrahim's resume so you can accurately answer job application questions, draft cover letters, tailor responses to job descriptions, and reference work history, skills, and education.

## Workflow

1. Read the resume file at the project root:

```
resume.md
```

2. Use the resume content to answer the user's question accurately — do not fabricate or embellish details beyond what the resume states.

## Guidelines

- **Be precise.** Use exact job titles, dates, company names, and metrics from the resume.
- **Tailor responses.** When the user provides a job description, map resume experience to the role's requirements.
- **Stay honest.** If the resume doesn't cover something the user asks about, say so rather than inventing details.
- **Match tone.** For application questions, write professionally. For casual questions, keep it conversational.
